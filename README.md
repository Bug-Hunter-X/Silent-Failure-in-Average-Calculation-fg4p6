This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The `calculate_average` function, as initially written, fails silently when the input list contains non-numeric values. This can lead to unexpected results and make debugging challenging. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach that handles potential errors gracefully.
